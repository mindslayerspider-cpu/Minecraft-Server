# Minecraft-Server

This repository includes a starter template for **DexOS 11**, a simple gaming-oriented custom ROM layer for Redmi Note 8 (`ginkgo`).

See: `rom/redmi-note8-gaming/README.md`

## Build a user-downloadable package

To make a downloadable starter package for users:

```bash
./scripts/build_release_zip.sh v1
```

This creates:

- `dist/DexOS-11-ginkgo-starter-v1.zip`

You can upload that zip to a GitHub Release so users can download it directly.
